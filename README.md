# burgerBonanza

 This application is a burger logger utilizing **MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars** and a **hard coded ORM**. 

 Users can view the burgers already in the system - choose to devour them or leave them there. If they devour them, they will move over to the eaten column. Users can also add their own burger and it will persist through MySQL.
